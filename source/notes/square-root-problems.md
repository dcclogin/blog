1. Infinite (intrusion of operator of `sqrt`) vs. Finitude of (precision of) any measurement. This is something I think the major problem of formulating functional square root.

2. It's relation and non-relation to another constellation of ideas "interactions". The rupture/break of non-classical. In what sense can we say logics, physics, (even including music here) is "classical"? Is there a maximal common ground of these "classicals"? What is the relation to `sqrt` operator and "interactions"/co-relations?

3. Local appearing (phenomenology) vs. Global being (ontology). According to Badiou's *Logics of Worlds*, set theory is ontology/being while logics of worlds is phenomenology/appearing. Explore the connections to quantum theories.

4. As for interactions/co-relations, also consider the potential of Parallax (concept by Slavoj Zizek).
