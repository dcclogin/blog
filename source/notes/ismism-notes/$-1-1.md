### Cosmology ($)

No presuppositions of cosmology here.

### Ontology (1)

The ontology is the *Logik*.

### Epistemology (1)

The epistemology is the consciousness/awareness of **copula** (系词), where copula is part of predicate.

```text
There is ...
```

It is essentially an **intention** (意向性) that sustains/waits to be filled with an **intentional object** (意向对象), but the ONLY object that can be filled is this intention *itself* (like an arrow pointing at itself). To put in another way: there is no `(be) sth.` but only `(be) [be(ing)]`. This hints at the famous `Being = Nothing`.

The Pure Thinking opens up the horizon of Subjectivity, but there is nothing in sight.

```text
  (perfect)        (dictate)      (lack/absence)
      1      <==================>       1       -------------------->    Nothing
(metaphysics)       (proxy)      (be as a copula)  
```


A metaphor might help:
- The Absolute (1) dictates (there is ...), but *there is nothing* to say.
- The Absolute (1) *divides itself* into the agent-Being (1) which is nothing but a lack (of determination).
- The agent-Being (1) is thus open to ... (any determinations)
- The Absolute (1), however, is retroactively constituted by the agent-Being (1).
