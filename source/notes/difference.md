This is a personal and experimental series. I plan to:
- Explore the possibility of "bootstrapping" Logics and Mathematics in the spirit of *Wissenschaft der Logik*.
- Explore the possibility of formalizing "Logics" that are alien to formal logicians, mathematicians, PL people.
- Re-search the "pre-history" of formal logic, mathematics, and computer science in the spirit of *Das Kapital*.
- Establish the emancipatory theory of modern computer science as a product of World War II (and Cold War).
- Doing critiques of, or exploring the gap/rupture/boundary in and between formal logic/math and other "Logics".
- Build bridges to our pioneers' theories and praxis including natural sciences like quantum theory; as well as politics.

For now, I will just post some draft articles with very little organization (they are temporarily categorized loosely by their themes and topics).

### Notes on *Wissenschaft der Logik*

[Ismism](https://xmind.app/m/WdEcdT/)'s patch on Hegel's *Logik*:

- $-1-1 [Pure Thinking](./ismism-notes/$-1-1)
    - $-1-1-1 [Nihilized Being](./ismism-notes/$-1-1-1)
    - $-1-1-2 [Limited Determination of Being](./ismism-notes/$-1-1-2)
    - $-1-1-3 [Oneness](./ismism-notes/$-1-1-3)

### List of questions

More "practical" questions of philosophical interest to me:

1. To account for ["classifiers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_classifier) in Chinese language.
2. To account for [adpositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adposition) in languages like English. Intuiting *In-ness* leads to Set Theory (the "canonical" theory of immanence), while *About-ness* leads to Phenomenology. What are we intuiting when we see a preposition like "for", "of", "at" and so on? (Phenomenology)
3. To account for the transparency of faults, errors, and unfaithfulness of logical reasoning. (Psychoanalysis and Phenomenology)
4. Phenomenology and quantum theory. Dialectical materialism and modern physics.
5. Medicine based on variants of Phenomenology, and Structuralism.
6. Alternative genesis of Artificial Intelligence (or temporarily, "transcendental AI").
