I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering (SICE), Indiana University Bloomington. I once majored in Bioinformatics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My interests range from theoretical aspects of programming languages to continental philosophy (Phenomenology as well as other descendants of German Idealism). I have a strong interest to reconcile PL/Mathematics/Formal Logics and continental philosophy. My favorite authors are Jean-Yves Girard, Alain Badiou, and Slavoj Žižek.

I am currently working on exploring quantum computing (quantum advantages, its relation to classical computing, its physical and philosophical implications etc.) from a programming language perspective. Nothing in conclusion so far :)

You may learn more about my philosophical obsessions from [here](../notes/difference). 

## List of stuff

[Cubical Sqrt](https://github.com/dcclogin/cubical-sqrt) - (In progress) the title is misleading since it's still experimental.
[λ-Circuit](https://github.com/dcclogin/SereneAzure/blob/master/lambda-circuits-215.pdf) - a graphical prototype language of lambda calculus.
 - [Slides](lambda-circuit-0.pdf), [Slides](), [Document]().
